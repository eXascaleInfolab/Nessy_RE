# Nessy: a Neuro-Symbolic System for Label Noise Reduction

- **Overview**: Nessy is a new neuro-symbolic system that takes advantage of *deep* and *probabilistic* modelling for inferring  latent classes, 
and of *symbolic knowledge* expressed as a set of logic rules for improving model inference. Unlike previous probabilistic methods, our deep probabilistic model 
adopts deep neural networks to parameterize data distributions, thus is able to model complex feature relationships in the data and to learn high-quality 
latent feature representations.

- **Datasets**: For our experiments, we use [TAC Relation Extraction Dataset](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/tacred/) available for download from [LDC TACRED webpage](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2018T24).
